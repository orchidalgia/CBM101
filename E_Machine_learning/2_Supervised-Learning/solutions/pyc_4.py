# model is probably overfitted. It "knows" the training data well and predicts perfectly
# The problem is that with new data it might perform very poorly because it can't generalize
# If your model is ever 100% accurate alarm bells should be ringing
# This might happen with small datasets/test sets without it being overfitting, 
# but with bigger data it's pretty much always sign of overfitting
