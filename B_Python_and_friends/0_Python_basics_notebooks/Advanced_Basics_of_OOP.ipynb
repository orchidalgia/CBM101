Notice how the arguments for a class are passed in the \\_\\_init\\_\\_ method and hence same number of arguments are to be passed while creating an instance, unless there is a default value assigned to the attribute.

    "# 7. MRO \n",
    "Explained simply, MRO is the way in which python determines the order in which the methods are resolved in case of multiple inheritance. Lets say both the parent classes have same method names, and we call the child with this method name. How does python figure out which method to execute? There is a complex algorithm which is used to order this sequence. For us, it is important to know that we can use \\_\\_mro\\_\\_ attribute, mro() method or help(cls) on the class to understand the order in which python will look for the methods of an instance. "
